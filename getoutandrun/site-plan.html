      <h3>Meet the Coaches</h3>
      <p>
        Coach Sarah! <br>
        I have been a lover of running since middle school cross country. I’ve run numerous 5Ks and 2-milers, a few 10Ks, and 3 half marathons. It’s tough to pick a favorite distance. I started coaching in 2017 when a friend asked me to build a training plan for them to run their first 5K. I couldn’t help but stay involved in the process beyond writing the plan. I loved getting to watch her develop a love and appreciation for running and I feel confident that I can help you do the same.
        <br>Coach Andrew!<br>
        <br>I started running by signing up for my high school’s track team until my coach convinced me to try cross country. I loved cross country even more, and went on to run cross country all through college. I was an NCAA champion my senior year and quickly realized that I wanted to spread the love of running with as many people as possible. I started coaching friends and family after college and have continually expanded my clients since then. I love people able to help people achieve their goals and achieve even more than they thought was possible.

Check out testimonials from a few of our GOAR athletes:
        <br>T_Sammy: I started working with Coach Andrew shortly after my 3rd child was born. I had never been a runner, but knew I needed something to do for myself and something that would help me be more active. Running accomplished both of those goals. Coach Andrew helped me ease into running in a smart way that has kept me injury free and enjoying every day that I get to hit the trails. Three years after starting out, I’m running farther than I ever pictured I would and feel strong and healthy to show up for my family when I get back from my run. -Sammy
        <br>T_Jenny: Coach Sarah has helped me reach new highs I had no idea were available to me! She is my biggest cheerleader, and comes with all the knowledge of a complete running textbook. This fall I am running my first marathon and I feel confident that I will be more than capable when the big day comes. Thank you, Sarah! –Jenny
        <br>T_Travis: The coaches at Get Out and Run and truly amazing people who really care about your success and wel-being as a runner. I started out working with Sarah, but had a chance to work with Andrew for a short while as well. They both helped me to stay focused on being a healthy runner who will be running for decades to come. Before I started working with them, I was using training plans that just weren’t built for me. I was pushing too hard, building up too quickly, and frequently getting injured. Now, I have more balance, more rest days, and more excitement about running. Surprisingly to me, I’ve been able to achieve even more now that I’m letting my body fully recover and build more efficiently. It’s all thanks to my awesome coaches. –Travis
        <br>T_Amber: Working with Coach Andrew has completely transformed my running. After a 3 year plateau, I thought I had achieved my fastest marathon time and was just going to slow down from here on out as I get older. Coach Andrew revamped my workouts, mileage, and recovery and within 9 months, I got a new PR!!! Now I feel like I’m just beginning to unlock my potential, and I can’t wait to see what the next few years bring! –Amber
