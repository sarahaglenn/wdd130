                <h2>Coach Sarah</h2>
                <p>I have been a lover of running since middle school cross country. I've run numerous 5Ks and 2-milers, a few 10Ks, and three half marathons. It's tough to pick a favorite distance. I started coaching in 2017 when a friend asked me to build a training plan for her to run her first 5K. I couldn't help but stay involved in the process beyond writing the plan. I loved getting to watch her develop a love and appreciation for running, and I feel confident that I can help you do the same.</p>

                <h2>Coach Andrew</h2>
                <p>I started running when I spontaneously signed up for my high school's track team. At the end of the season, my coach convinced me to try cross country. I loved cross country even more, and went on to run cross country all through college. I was an NCAA champion and quickly realized that I wanted to spread the love of running with as many people as possible. I started coaching friends and family after college and have continually expanded my clients since then. I love being able to help people achieve their goals and accomplish even more than they thought possible. </p>
