                <p>Coach Sarah has helped me reach new highs I had no idea were possible! She is my biggest cheerleader and comes with all the knowledge of a complete running textbook. This fall I am running my first marathon and I feel confident that I will be more than capable when the big day comes. Thank you, Sarah! </p>

                <p>Working with Coach Andrew has completely transformed my running. After a 3 year plateau, I thought I had achieved my fastest marathon time and was just going to slow down from here on out as I get older. Coach Andrew revamped my workouts, mileage, and recovery. Within 9 months, I got a new PR!!! Now I feel like I'm just beginning to unlock my potential, and I can't wait to see what the next few years bring! </p>

                <p>I started working with Coach Andrew shortly after my 3rd child was born. I had never been a runner, but knew I needed something to do for myself and something that would help me be more active. Running accomplished both of those goals. Coach Andrew helped me ease into running in a smart way that has kept me injury free and enjoying every day that I get to hit the trails. Three years after starting out, I'm running farther than I ever pictured I would and feeling strong and healthy to show up for my family when I get back from my run. </p>

                <p>The coaches at Get Out and Run are truly amazing people who really care about your success and well-being as a runner. I started working with Sarah, but had a chance to work with Andrew for a short time as well. They both helped me stay focused on being a healthy runner who will be running for decades to come. Before I started working with them, I was using training plans that just weren't built for me. I was pushing too hard, building up too quickly, and frequently getting injured. Now, I have more balance, more rest days, and more excitement about running. Surprisingly to me, Iâ€™ve been able to achieve even more now that I'm letting my body fully recover and build more efficiently. It's all thanks to my awesome coaches. </p>
