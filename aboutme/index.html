    <p>Hey friends! I am a math teacher currently filling in as a long term sub for 1st grade. Running is my favorite hobby, but I also love to hike, read, and belt Taylor Swift songs in the car.</p>
    <p>I have 4 kids, have been married for almost 12 years, and have lived in California for the last 9 years. My favorite things about living in California have been hiking through the rewoods, exploring national parks like Yosemite, and running through the mountains around Lake Tahoe. </p>
    <p>My current goal with going back to school is to obtain a software development degree. I'm excited to learn new skills and hoping it turns into a career pivot. This is going to be a fun class and I'm excited to work with and get to know y'all! Thanks for stopping by to say hi.</p>
