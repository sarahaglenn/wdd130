    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to get customers to book rafting trips with Adventures in the Rockies by showing the different trips available, helping them feel comfortable, and providing an online booking portal or booking phone number. They will be able to read information about how to prepare for 
        their trip, what to bring, the address to arrive, etc. There will be a section to get to know the crew, view pictures, read testimonials, and read FAQs.

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The audience for this website is people considering a white water rafting trip. They could be nearby residents, but will likely be tourists. The audience includes people in the age bracket that the rafting company allows- around 10yo and beyond.
        It will be important to have representation from multiple age groups in the site pictures so that people can envision themselves taking a trip. The audience includes retirees, newlyweds, families, corporate groups, and others vacationing in the area. Because they are on trip, they 
        are looking for excursions to add to their experience and be willing to spend more than they would at home. They will be using a combination of laptops, desktops, and mobile devices to view information and book. They are people who like to spend time outdoors 
        (or one person in their group does) or wanting to try something new. They are looking for escape and adventure from their day-to-day lives and will be expecting an out of the ordinary experience.
